The API provides access to data on laureates, prizes, and other related information. The data is returned in JSON format, which is a common format for web APIs. It is in good practice to not overwhelm public APIs with too many requests in a short period of time, so we will be using caching to store the data locally after the first request.\nRequests can also be limited by only pulling data from certain years, or drawing a certain number of overall results. For this project, we will be pulling all available data. All code provided inlcudes citation of the API’s official endpoint and documentation link. Nobel Prize API Documentation"

There are additional steps between storing the data and saving it to a CSV. These include sorting the data and putting it in a desirable format.\nAdditionally, I made dummy variables for the categories and portions. This was done to allow for multiple linear regression if desired. All of the original variables were kept in the final dataset as well. This made the dataset more versatile, allowing for string analysis on the ‘motivation’ variable."

The following graphs highlight some of the interesting trends found in the data centered around the motivating questions.\n\nThe portion variable in our data indicates how many people were on the team that won, we can use 1/n to know how many people are in each group. Because a single award can be given to up to three people or an organization. The entries with 1/4 proportion are organizations that won the prize.\nFrom the plot we know that nearly all of literature prizes are given to single individuals, while the sciences and peace prizes are more likely to be shared among multiple laureates or organizations. Physics have the highest proportion of prizes given to organizations, while Medicine and Physiology have the highest rate of 3-person groups for the prize. It can be fairly intuitive why literature prizes are almost exclusively given to individuals, while other categories may favor group work. It is surprising to me that chemistry highly favors small-groups and individuals rather than organizations.\n\nThis plot shows the rolling average of the number of laureates per prize over time. We can see that in general, the number of laureates per prize has increased over time, indicating a trend towards more collaborative work being recognized. The Peace prize shows the most significant increase in the number of laureates per prize, which may reflect the complex nature of peace efforts that often involve multiple stakeholders. The other categories show a more modest increase, but the overall trend is clear: more people are being recognized for their contributions to these fields.\n\nThis plot shows the number of years without a prize being awarded in each category. The category for economic sciences only started in 1969, 68 years after all of the other categories had their first prizes awarded. So in reality, peace has the highest number of years without a prize awarded."
